# A* Pathfinding Visualization Upgrade

A modern, interactive A* Pathfinding visualization built with Pygame.

## Features

- **Interactive Nodes:** Drag the Start (Green) and End (Red) nodes anywhere on the grid.
- **Dynamic Obstacles:** Click and drag with the Left Mouse Button (LMB) to draw walls, or Right Mouse Button (RMB) to erase them.
- **Animated Exploration:** Watch the algorithm in real-time as it explores the open set (orange) and closed set (turquoise).
- **Control Sidebar:** Clearly listed shortcuts and instructions.
- **Shortcuts:**
  - `SPACE`: Run the A* algorithm.
  - `R`: Reset the path (keeps obstacles).
  - `C`: Clear the entire grid (removes obstacles).

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python PYGAME.py
   ```
